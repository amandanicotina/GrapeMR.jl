# GrapeMR
### GrapeMR is a Julia package that numerically designes pulse sequences with NMR/MRI applications. By defining a cost funciton, the algorithm calculates step-by-step what is the best pulse sequence for this specific problem.


## Getting Started

```bash
$ julia
julia>] activate .
pkg>
julia>exit()
$ cd docs && julia --project make.jl
$ open build/index.html
```
