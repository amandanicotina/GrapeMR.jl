# GrapeMR
 GrapeMR.jl is a Julia package that numerically designes pulse sequences for NMR/MRI applications. By defining a cost funciton, the algorithm calculates step-by-step what is the best pulse sequence for a specific problem.

## Documentation

You can access the latest documentation on [GrapeMR's Github Pages](https://amandanicotina.github.io/GrapeMR.jl/dev/) where you'll find an introduction, a brief tutorial, API documentation, and details on how to develop on the package.

## Compatibility

The package is tested on Julia 1.9.4 and 1.11.2 on Linux (amd64), MacOS (amd64, arm64), and Windows (amd64).
Other julia versions may work, but are not tested. Other platforms are not supported.
